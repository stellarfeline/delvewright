## Diagnostics

### DW032x/033x — sound & art-title validation (`compiler::atmos`; error; exit 1)

Content checks (spec-0014) that need compiler-vendored data (the pinned
`sound_event` registry) or the `delve:art` font, run in the compiler's
`validate_stage` (so `validate`/`analyze`/`build` all catch them) and reported at
**validation tier (exit 1)** like the `DW01xx` codes — not build-tier. No-op for a
campaign that uses neither the `play-sound` effect nor the `narrate` `art` style.

**Nested-effect consumer recursion.** These scans (`sound_refs`/
`play_sound_actor_refs` → `DW0326`/`DW0335`, `art_narrates` → `DW0328`) descend
**every nested effect list** (`sequence` steps, `on_respawn`/`on_caught`/`on_arrive`
bundles) through the one `each_effect_ref` traversal, keyed by the same position
scheme as the l10n inventory — so a bad sound id / non-Latin art string buried in a
timeline is caught, not shipped unvalidated. The DSL-side effect-ref consumer scans
(`spawn-wave` → `DW0170`, `give-item`/`collect`/`requires_item` → `DW0143`,
`set-block`/`prop` → `DW0193`, `move-npc`/`despawn-npc` → `DW0112`, per-effect
`requires_flags` → `DW0172`) likewise recurse via `for_each_effect_deep` /
`for_each_trigger_effect_deep`. This matches how the flag/wave **producer** scans and
emission descend; a top-level effect keeps its own path/key.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `DW0326` | A `play-sound.sound` or `narrate.sound` id is not a known 1.21.11 sound event (validated against the vendored `sound_event` registry, `crates/delvec/data/sounds-1.21.11.json`; `minecraft:` prefix optional). |
| `DW0328` | An `art`-styled `narrate` string — the English source **or** any declared-language sidecar translation — uses a character outside the `delve:art` font's glyph inventory (A–Z, 0–9, space, `! " ' ( ) , - . / : ; ?`; lowercase folds to uppercase). Forces per-language art titles to stay ASCII/Latin — a `zh-cn` art translation must be an ASCII rendition. |
| `DW0335` | A `play-sound` targets `at: {actor: …}`. A sound plays at fixed coordinates or at each listener's own position, and the compiler resolves no position for a live actor, so the sound would be silent. Use `at: {anchor}` or `at: players`. |

#### The `delve:art` font

An original 5×7 pixel bitmap font authored in `compiler::atmos` (`ART_GLYPHS`), baked
into `resourcepack.zip` as `assets/delve/font/art.json` +
`assets/delve/textures/font/art.png` — and **only** when the campaign uses `style:
art`, so a non-art campaign's pack stays byte-identical. The PNG is written by a
hand-rolled deterministic encoder (stored DEFLATE, no compressor), like the pack's
hand-rolled ZIP/SHA-1.

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `CELL` / `GW` / `GH` | 8 / 5 / 7 | atlas cell, glyph ink width, glyph ink height, in source px |
| `ART_SCALE` | **1** | the provider's source-pixel scale — the one knob for on-screen size |
| `ART_HEIGHT` / `ART_ASCENT` | 8 / 7 | provider `height` / `ascent` = `CELL·ART_SCALE` / `GH·ART_SCALE` |
| `ART_GLYPH_ADVANCE` | **6** | `GW·ART_SCALE + 1`, vanilla's `round(ink·height/cellHeight)+1` |
| `ART_SPACE_ADVANCE` | 4 | the `space` provider's advance, `4·ART_SCALE` |

**`ART_SCALE` must stay an integer** — the font atlas is sampled nearest-neighbour,
so a fractional scale splits a source pixel across screen pixels and the glyph edges
go ragged. An art `narrate` renders in the vanilla **title** slot, so the provider
scale and the slot's ×4 pose scale multiply: at scale 4 a glyph is 21 font px and
`DW0330`'s 90 px budget holds *four*; at 2 it is 11 px and holds 8. `ART_SCALE` is
**1**, the largest integer scale that fits **15** glyphs. The title slot still draws
it ×4, so an art title is a title-sized blocky all-caps banner occupying a title's
share of the screen. `ART_ASCENT = GH·ART_SCALE`
keeps the ink sitting exactly on the baseline at any scale.

The width model treats every glyph as a flat `ART_GLYPH_ADVANCE`. That is exact for
every letter and digit (all ink the full 5 columns) and deliberately **conservative**
for the few narrow punctuation glyphs (`'`, `(`, `!`), which vanilla advances less —
`DW0330` never under-measures a line.
