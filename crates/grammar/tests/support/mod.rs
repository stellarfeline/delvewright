//! Reading an expanded model the way a player meets it: what a body can stand
//! in, what a walker can reach, and what an eye can see.
//!
//! The sightline walk is the compiler's: eye at 1.62 over the watch cell, target
//! at 1.0 over the observed cell, Amanatides–Woo cell traversal, both endpoint
//! cells exempt (`crates/compiler/src/nav.rs`, which `DW0388` uses). The
//! generator's idea of a sightline and the compiler's must not drift apart, so
//! the shape is copied rather than reinvented.
//!
//! `tests/staging.rs` carries its own copy of these helpers: it landed first,
//! and two more vocabulary families are in review against that file right now.
//! Folding it onto this module is a follow-up that costs nothing to do later and
//! would cost every one of those PRs a conflict to do now.
